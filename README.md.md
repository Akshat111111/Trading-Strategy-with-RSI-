<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>The following is a project on creating a trading strategy utilizing the existing trend indicators.<br>
Here we select the famous <strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</strong> and <strong>Stochastic RSI (SRSI)</strong> for the basis of our strategy and the indicator <strong>Ichimoku</strong> for a comparison.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><strong>RSI</strong> and <strong>SRSI</strong> behave very differently even though one is based on another. The <strong>RSI</strong> is a stable, low-volatile indicator used for trend confirmation and predictions over long-term historical data. Meanwhile, the <strong>RSI</strong> is a highly sensitive and volatile indicator that frequently reaches its extreme values. By using the strong confirmation of the <strong>RSI</strong> in conjunction with the rapid arbitrage of the <strong>SRSI</strong>, we can achieve a strong trend signal with reliable results.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p><strong>Ichimoku</strong> being a well-renowned indicator for its low-volatile, consistent returns gave a <strong>14.3%</strong> profit return in the <em>Nifty-50</em> stock over our sample trading period. It performed a total of 187 trades.<br>
Meanwhile, our strategy achieved a net total of <strong>31%</strong> returns over the same situation, making 57 total trades out of which 29 were profitable.</p>
In the trading strategy mentioned, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic RSI (SRSI) indicators are used as part of the overall analysis. Here are some details on how these indicators are typically used:

1. Relative Strength Index (RSI):
   - The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 considered overbought and readings below 30 considered oversold.
   - The default setting for the RSI is 14 days, but this can be adjusted based on the trader's preference and the timeframe being analyzed.
   - The formula for calculating the RSI involves comparing the average gain and average loss over a specified period. The RSI formula is as follows:
     RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
     where RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
   - The RSI can be used to identify potential trend reversals, overbought or oversold conditions, and divergence between price and the indicator.
   - Traders often combine the RSI with other technical indicators or trading strategies for better signal interpretation. Some popular combinations include RSI with MACD, moving averages, or price action.

2. Stochastic RSI (SRSI):
   - The Stochastic RSI is a combination of the Stochastic oscillator and the RSI. It aims to provide a more sensitive and faster responding version of the RSI.
   - The SRSI oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 80 considered overbought and readings below 20 considered oversold.
   - The SRSI is calculated by applying the Stochastic formula to the RSI values instead of price values. This helps identify overbought or oversold conditions within the RSI itself.
   - Traders can use the SRSI to identify potential trend reversals, overbought or oversold conditions, and divergences between the SRSI and price.
   - Similar to the RSI, the SRSI can be combined with other technical indicators or trading strategies for better signal interpretation.

It's important to note that while the RSI and SRSI indicators can provide valuable insights, they have limitations and should not be relied upon as standalone signals. Traders should consider using other technical indicators, price patterns, and fundamental analysis to confirm and validate their trading decisions. Additionally, proper risk management techniques, such as setting stop losses and profit targets, should be implemented to mitigate potential losses.
